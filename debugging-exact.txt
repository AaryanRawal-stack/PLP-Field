### Summary of Findings and Next Steps

Based on our review and independent tests:

1. **Extraction Logic Verification:**  
   - **waitForElement:**  
     This function effectively polls for a specific DOM element (such as the follower modal) until it appears, which aligns with our tests.
   - **extractFollowers:**  
     This function now uses a simplified approach (similar to the content script) to directly extract visible usernames (or parse them from href attributes). It then creates enhanced follower objects (with `username` and an initially null `isPrivate` field) that are updated asynchronously via API calls.
   - **Continuous Scroll Cycle:**  
     The scroll function accumulates these enhanced follower objects from the follower modal as the page loads more entries. Your tests confirm that this process identifies usernames correctly.

2. **Current Issue with CSV Export:**  
   The CSV export feature is failing with a “No followers to export” error. This suggests that although the extraction logic is working in isolation, the enhanced follower objects might not be flowing correctly from the content script (and extractionUtils.js) to the background script and ultimately into storage.

3. **Next Steps:**  
   - **Data Flow Investigation:**  
     Examine the data transmission from content-script.js (via its update callback) to the background.js export handler. Confirm that enhanced follower objects are being sent and stored under the expected key in chrome.storage.
   - **Timing and Triggering:**  
     Verify that the extraction process is triggered at the correct moment so that the follower modal is fully loaded before extraction begins.
   - **Debug Logging:**  
     Consider adding additional debug logging in both the content script and background script to trace the follower data as it moves through the system.

This summary, along with the ReadMe, should provide a clear understanding of the current state of the extension and outline the next steps for resolving the CSV export issue. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
