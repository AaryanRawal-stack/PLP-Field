# Instagram Extraction Review

## Updated Extraction Logic

### extractionUtils.js
- **Original Behavior:**  
  - Extracted usernames as simple strings from DOM elements using a regex filter and stored them in a Set.
  - Sent the extracted usernames for API verification, but the regex was overly expansive.
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - **Simplified Extraction:**  
    Instead of relying on an extensive regex filter, extractionUtils.js now adopts the content.js approach. It directly reads the visible username from each element’s inner text (or extracts it from the href if necessary), ensuring that only the usernames that are actually visible are processed.
  - **Enhanced Data Structure:**  
    For every valid username, an enhanced follower object is created with two properties:  
      - `username`
      - `isPrivate` (initially set to null and later updated asynchronously via API calls)
    These objects are accumulated in a Map.
  - **Genuine API Integration (Unchanged):**  
    The function `fetchUserPrivacyStatus` is still used to asynchronously determine whether each username is public or private. It first attempts the public Instagram API (after removing any anti-scraping prefix) and then falls back to an internal API endpoint if needed. If both attempts fail, it resolves with `"not found"`.
  - **Overall Impact:**  
    The new approach produces the same end result as before (each username gets verified for privacy status) but does so more directly by mimicking the content.js extraction logic.

### content-script.js
- **Original Behavior:**  
  - Extracted simple usernames from the modal and sent them as an array of strings.
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - Now, the content script receives enhanced follower objects (with `username` and `isPrivate`) from the updated extractionUtils.js.
  - The callback (`updateUserWithFollowers`) and progress messaging remain unchanged.

### background.js
- **Original Behavior:**  
  - Aggregated and exported simple lists of usernames.
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - Now handles enhanced follower objects, deduplicates them, and generates CSV exports that include a "Public Status" column based on the `isPrivate` property.
  - No changes are required in how the background script receives or processes data.

### store.js (Vuex Store)
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - A new state property (`followers`) and corresponding mutations/actions were added to store and update the enhanced follower objects.
  - This supports the UI components that display enhanced data.

### optionspage.vue & popup/app.vue
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - Both UI components now optionally display the count of enhanced follower objects.
  - Their core functionality remains unchanged.

### messaging.js & logger.js
- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - Only comments were updated (if needed) to clarify that payloads may now include enhanced follower objects.
  - No functional changes were necessary.

## Summary of Impact Across Modules

| Module Name           | Impact Description                                                                                                               | Changes Made                                                                          | Refactoring Required        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **extractionUtils.js**    | Enhanced extraction now uses the content.js approach instead of heavy regex filtering; builds enhanced follower objects.         | - Removed extensive regex filtering; directly reads visible text/href.<br>- Retains asynchronous API calls. | Moderate – New extraction logic integrated.  |
| **content-script.js**     | Uses enhanced data from utils (enhanced follower objects) instead of simple strings.                                           | - Update callback now processes enhanced objects.                                     | Moderate – Minor adjustments to data handling.  |
| **background.js**         | Aggregates, stores, and exports enhanced data.                                                                              | - CSV generation updated to include “Public Status” based on `isPrivate`.               | Moderate – CSV and storage logic updated.       |
| **store.js (Vuex Store)** | UI state now includes a property for enhanced follower objects.                                                             | - New state property, mutation, and action for followers.                             | Minimal – Minor state updates.                  |
| **optionspage.vue**       | Optionally displays the count of enhanced follower objects.                                                                 | - Added computed property and UI element to show enhanced follower count.             | Minimal – Optional UI tweaks.                   |
| **popup/app.vue**         | Reflects enhanced data progress.                                                                                            | - Added computed property to show enhanced follower count in the scraping step.       | Minimal – Only minor updates needed.            |
| **messaging.js**          | Communication supports enhanced payloads.                                                                                  | - Updated comments to clarify payload structure.                                      | Minimal – Comments updated only.                |
| **logger.js**             | Logging remains generic.                                                                                                     | - No changes required.                                                                | None – No refactoring needed.                   |

This updated progress.txt now reflects the streamlined extraction approach in utils and its integration with the rest of the system.
